            Mall:
You head over to the mall with Alice.

\"You're already so pretty, but I think a makeover would be so fun!\"

> Look at clothes
> Look at makeup
> Look at game store
> Eat some food

Clothes:
\"We can get anything you want\" Alice says, gesturing at the wide variety of clothing stores. \"What do you want?\"

> plain and boring
> Bright and colorful
> Dark and moody
> Clown



Makeup:
\"This place has so many options\" Alice says excitedly

\"What look are you going for\"

> Simple and natural
> Like a drag queen
> Like a clown (TODO special interaction with Ronald)

Simple:
You buy some blush and nice lipstick.

Alice leads you to a bench by the hand, and starts opening up the containers of makeup. \"You're going to look so beautiful\" she remarks as she applies it.

When she's done she pulls out a mirror, and you look incredible. \"Wow\" Alice says \"you look beautiful\"

Drag:
\"Bold, and dramatic, I like it\" she remarks

You buy some intense eyeshadow and lipstick with neon hues, and a fair amount of glitter.

Alice leads you to a bench by the hand, and starts opening up the containers of makeup. \"You're going to look so dramatic\" she remarks as she applies it.

When she's done she pulls out a mirror, revealing the exaggerated makeup \"I love it\" she says, \"it shows off your beauty\"

Clown:
\"You'll be the prettiest clown ever\" she remarks.

You buy a number of face paints in white, red, and yellow. Unfortunately the store was fresh out of red clown noses.

Alice leads you to a bench by the hand, and starts opening up tubes of face paint. You can smell the thick paint as she applies it to your face.

When she's done she pulls out a mirror, revealing a face so beautifully painted it would put Bozo to shame. \"I love it\" she says, \"it matches your personality perfectly\"

Game store:
You enter the game store (name? TODO) and look around. There's tons of shelves with board games, video games, cards, and even a few buckets of dice of every color and shape. There is a door in the back with a sign that says \"GAME ROOM\" above it.

> enter the door
> Look at the dice
> Leave

Dice: (TODO move to elsewhere in the mall?)
You look at the dice of various hues of plastic. You find one that looks unusual.

It's surface is opalescent white, almost like a pearl. But it's rather heavy for its size. It's a d20, but none of the faces have any symbols on them.

> keep it
> Leave it

Inside the room is a large circular table with a bunch of dice and sheets of paper. Looks like some kind of table top game.

You glance at one of the sheets, it looks like dungeons and dragons.

> (if you have the die) you feel a vibration in your pocket
> Leave

You take out the die from earlier and examine it. It seems to be emitting a high pitched ring.

> roll it and see what happens
> Leave

You roll the die on the table, it begins to spin like a top on the table, spinning faster and faster. It emits beams of light that flash across the room like a disco ball. It emits a warbling sound that pulses faster and faster, until eventually the sound and light become so intense that it drowns out everything else

Then, you find yourself on a ship that appears to be flying through space. A small potted plant with limbs made of roots walls over to you. It says in a high pitched voice \"Hello! And welcome to The Chimera!\"

> \"huh?\"

\"This is our ship! And I am Peepo\"

((Hey Alex, I've got a really weird question but please humor me, it'll be very funny.
In the campaign, let's say you wanted to kill off / get rid of a minor character that no one really cares about. For whatever reason, you want them gone as quickly as possible so the story can move on without them. What event would you cause in universe to get rid of them))

Events take place, eventually Bella is killed or removed from the world

Returning to \"reality\":
You fall to the ground with a thud, you're back in the game room, holding the strange die from earlier.

Leave-the-mall 
“Well, Bella, why don’t we go back to my house and do a little fashion show? I’m sure my family would love to see your new outfit.” You start to sputter out a protest but Alice starts laughing before you can get even one full word out. “No, no, I know you would hate that. We’ll save that for a special day later on,” she says, winking. You let out a sigh of relief, but your stomach still clenches at the thought of a future fashion show. 

“We can just relax, NETFLIX and chill, that kind of thing.” Alice continues, linking her arm with yours. “Come on — I’m sure you’re exhausted after all this wonderful shopping.”

Options:
Go back to Alice’s house 

Go-to-Cullen-House
You slide into the passenger’s seat of Alice’s shiny yelow convertible. It’s a little ostentatious for your taste. Alice flings the shopping bags onto the rear seats and jumps in beside you. 

She looks spaced out for a moment before grinning, turning the key, and gunning the convertible out of the parking space. You grab onto the door handle for dear  as she drifts around the corner and onto the main road. 

“Alice, don’t you think you should slow down?!” You yell over the sound of the rushing wind. 

Alice laughs again, shaking head a little as she chirps out, “Nah, Bella, don’t worry! We’ll be fine. There’s no cops on the way and the traffic isn’t too bad — we’ll get home in just a jiffy!” She swerves between traffic with ease. 

She seems like a good enough driver that you don’t think you’ll die in a fiery inferno, but you’re not convinced. You hold on tighter to the handle. 

True to her word, Alice pulls into the Cullen garage a short 20 minutes later. The drive from Port Angeles usually takes an hour. 

Alice bustles you and the bags out of the car and into the main hallway of the house. “What do you want to do first?”

Options:
Bathroom — you have to anxiety pee after the drive you just survived 
Alice’s bedroom — you want to relax

Bathroom

“Could I use your restroom real quick, Alice?” 

“Oh! Sure, Bella! We stocked it up with all the human products you could need. It’s the 2nd door on the right, down that way.” She points.

You had actually been a little worried that the Cullen’s wouldn’t have any toilet paper. Do vampires shit? You didn’t think so. 

“Great, thank you so much.” You start towards the bathroom as Alice zips upstairs with the shopping bags.

Options: 
Use the bathroom
Snoop around the other doors

Use-bathroom

The bathroom is modern, large, and immaculately clean. The concrete floor shines in a way that suggests a recent polish — you think you could probably see your reflection in it. 

You quickly glance at the mirror, then turn and face it head-on. You’re begrudgingly pleased with how your makeup turned out. You run your hands over your wind-blown hair in an attempt to calm it. Alice would probably say your hair looks “bohemian chic”, but that’s not really your style.

Once your hair is in a more respectable state, you turn and face the toilet. Like many rich people’s houses, the Cullens have their toilets tucked into enclosed wash closets. Their’s is a little unusual — the walls are all glass. What’s the point? You think to yourself, frowning. Weirdly enough, there’s an upholsterer chair in the bathroom that directly faces the glass-enclosed toilet. Rich people are strange. 

You take care of your business and leave the bathroom. Where do you go?

Upstairs to Alice’s room 
Snoop around the other doors.

Snoop-around

You stop just outside the bathroom door. You glance around the hallway, checking to see if anyone else is around. Seeing no-one, you decide that it’s only expected that you do a little snooping. 

You open the doors along the hallway one by one. The first door you open contains sports attire and various equipment. There’s rows upon rows of various balls, clubs, bats, and oddly, a row of whips. 

You step closer and notice that there’s various leather bands in a bin next to the row of whips.You frown, trying to think why someone would need so many whips and various leather goods. Maybe Jasper learned to whip competitively when he was growing up in the south. You don’t really want to think about the implications behind that. You leave the room quickly.

You open three of the last four doors in quick progression. They’re unremarkable — more storage, mostly. One room is filled floor to ceiling with toilet paper. You wonder if vampires know how much toilet paper the average human needs. What did they even use for toilet paper when the Cullens were human? You wonder, examining the tower of toilet paper. Leaves? Pages of heretical texts condemned by the church? 

The last door, the one closest to the garage, is locked. You hold your ear against the door, trying to quiet your hearbeat so you can hear what’s inside. Silence answers you, until, out of no-where, you hear a clown horn. Surprised, you drawn in your breath sharply. The sound ends before you can really process it, and even though you wait outside the door for a few moments more, you don’t hear anything else. 

Options:
Go to Alice’s room

Alice-room

You make your way up the stairs slowly, observing the artwork on the walls as you go. There’s some kind of ombre design created with graduation caps taking up most of the wall space. There must be a couple hundred graduation caps included in the piece.

Alice pops her head around the corner at the top of the stairs. “Bella! Over here.” You startle, losing your footing and begin to fall backwards down the stairs. Alice is there betore you move more than an inch towards your certain death or disfigurement, grabbing your arm firmly but gently as her other arm comes to wrap around your waist. “Whoah, Bella! You’re so silly. It’s just little ole me.” She smiles at you as she walks you up the stairs and down the hallway to the right, keeping her arms around you as you go.

You enter her room, decorated with yellow Chinoiserie wallpaper and robin’s egg blue upholstery on the four poster bed in the center of the room and the small seating area by the window. You’d expected a more modern design like the rest of the Cullen’s house, but the more traditional, bold design of the room suits her. 

“Ok! Here we are.” Alice smiles at you again as she unwrapping herself from around you. You feel a complicated feeling as she pulls away from you. “I hope you like it! I decorated it myself. The wallpaper is hand printed in France, and the bed is antique from Italy.” 

She plops down at the end of the bed, bouncing a little as her weight settles. She pats the space next to her invitingly. “So, what would you like to do?”

Options:
Netflix and chill
Netflix and actually just chill

Netflix-and-chill

You sit down next to Alice. The bed is plush, the most luxurious mattress you’ve ever felt covered by the smoothest silk sheets. You look down to where your fingers are spread out on the mattress, sinking into the plush. Your fingers are nearly touching Alice’s. It would only take a millimeter to breach the distance between. 

“I think… I think a nature documentary would be good?” You ask hestitantily. You’re sure Alice is more of a Love Island kind of girl, but you’ve always found the sound of Obama’s voice titillating. 

“Bella, I want to worship you. Lick my way up your body — not in an evil vampire way, but a sexy vampire way. You have no idea how much you tortured me today. You looked perfection in your new outfit.” 

Bella gets dirty 

Netflix-just-chill

“I’m pretty tired. I think my brain can only handle watching a few episodes of something,” You reply.

“Sure!” Alice reaches across the bedspread 

Esme comes in with a fresh smoothie for Bella. She’s a gardening enthusiast and is so pleased to finally have someone to try out home-grown cooking with. Usually she donated her fresh produce to the food pantry or the elementary school. 

Bella spills a smoothie on herself. 

Grimace-Key
Alice leaves the room to get a warm, wet cloth to wipe you down with. Laying there, you spot something shining out of the corner of your eye. Bookshelf. Iconic McDonald’s double arches. Huh. I didn’t know Alice was a McDonald’s fan. That’s so capitalist of her. Attached to the arches is a key. Without thinking, you grab the key and stuff it in your backpack. You hear Alice remark something to Esme in the hallway, and hurry back to the bed to lie innocently in your mess again.
